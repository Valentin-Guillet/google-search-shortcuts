# Google Search Shortcuts

This is a fork of [jchafik's extension](https://github.com/jchafik/google-search-shortcuts) that adds back Google Search navigation shortcuts.
From the results page, press any key to bring focus back to the search box. Use the TAB and arrow keys to navigate between search results.
All functionality is configurable.
